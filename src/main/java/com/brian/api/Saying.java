/**

 * STEP 4. Create a representation class. We will model this JSON representation
 * {
 *     "id": 1,
 *     "content": "Hi!"
 * }
 *
 *This is a pretty simple POJO, but there are a few things worth noting here.
 *
 * First, itâ€™s immutable. This makes Saying instances very easy to reason about in multi-threaded environments as well as single-threaded environments.
 * Second, it uses the JavaBeans standard for the id and content properties.
 * This allows Jackson to serialize it to the JSON we need.
 * The Jackson object mapping code will populate the id field of the JSON object with the return value of #getId(), likewise with content and #getContent().
